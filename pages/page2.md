# Introduction
...  

Before the invention of CSS Flexbox, web designers were limited in their ability to control the position and size of elements on a page.  

They had to use a combination of:
- `float`s,
- `position`ing,
- and other hacks to create the layouts they wanted.

 But then, in 2017, a new technology was introduced to the world of web design - <span class="blue">**CSS Flexbox**</span>.

# Introduction
...  

With Flexbox, designers were finally able to easily control the alignment, direction, and distribution of elements within a container. They could create flexible and responsive designs with ease, and make their websites look great on any device. 

_"And so, Flexbox became a game changer in the web design industry, and is now an essential tool for any modern web designer."_

# What is Flex-Box ?

The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its itemsâ€™ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.

Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack flexibility to support large or complex applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).

Note: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.
